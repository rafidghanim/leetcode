# Documentation

This `docs/` directory contains templates and guidelines to help write clear, consistent problem write-ups and repository documentation.

Templates included:
- PROBLEM_WRITEUP_TEMPLATE.md — Template for writing problem write-ups and solutions.
- SOLUTION_STYLE_GUIDE.md — Code and documentation style guidelines.
- CONTRIBUTING_DOC_TEMPLATE.md — Template to help contributors write documentation and what to include in PRs.

How to use these templates

1. Copy the `PROBLEM_WRITEUP_TEMPLATE.md` into the language/problem directory (e.g., `python/1-two-sum/WRITEUP.md`) when you add a solution.
2. Follow the `SOLUTION_STYLE_GUIDE.md` when writing code and comments.
3. Use `CONTRIBUTING_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` when preparing documentation updates or improving existing write-ups.

If you want, I can also generate a mapped index of existing problems into a single `docs/index.md` file.
